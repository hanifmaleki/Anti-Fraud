## Description

Here, in the beginning, a simple measure is taken in order to prevent fraudsters from illegally transferring a large portion of the currency from an account. Suppose some scammers have just gotten access to confidential financial information through some phishing or pharming attacks. They immediately try to transfer as much currency as possible to their accounts. Most of the time the account holder is not aware of the attack. Hence, the antifraud system should prevent it before it is too late.

In the first stage, you need to create a simple rest endpoint that calculates whether a transaction is ALLOWED, PROHIBITED, or need MANUAL_PROCESSING by using the amount of the transaction.
