<h2>Description</h2>

<p>A rule-based system ....</p>

<ol>
    <li>Giving into account transactions history</li>
    <li>Introduce trx types</li>
    <li>Distinguish intelligently amongs different types of transactions</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>List of transactions properties</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Transaction date</li>
    <li>Transaction amount //TODO BigDecimal</li>
    <li>Transaction applications (Insurance, Food, Transfer, Online-Shop-real-ware, Online-Shop digital-ware,....)</li>
    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>Country</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The philosophy behind the rules is that the probability of fraud in different types of the transactions are not the
    same
    e.g. For type insurance the probability is the lowest while a frauder is likely to try some transaction of type
    transfer
</p>

<p>
    The expected amount is also different in each type of transaction. While buying real ware of price 180 seems norma,
    the same amount need manual verification on a transaction of type food.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Each transaction is queried considering last 3 transaction of a given credit card.</p>

<p>Enrich the fraud detection service considering the following rules:</p>

<ol>
    <li>If the transactions in the last 24 hours are from more than 2 countries =&gt; Fraud</li>
    <li>If the transactions in the last 24 hours are from more than 3 IPs =&gt; Fraud</li>
    <li>If the transactions in the last 24 hours are from 2 countries =&gt; Personal</li>
    <li>If the transactions in the last 24 hours are from 3 IPs =&gt; Personal</li>
    <li>If a transaction is known as manual, the next transactions would be either manual or prohibited (unless ....)
    </li>
    <li>If a transaction is known as fraud, the next transactions would be fraud (unless ....)</li>
    <li>Rules on transactions amounts for each transactions based on the type
