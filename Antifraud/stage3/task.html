<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Normally hackers use specific IP-addresses. As a result you should be cautious about activities on such a network
    address.
    In addition, some card numbers are reported as stolen.
    The anti-fraud system should prohibit any transaction of the stolen cards.</p>

<p>
    In this stage, the anti-fraud system would be enabled to get a list of prohibited card numbers as well as suspicious
    IP address and banned them from doing transactions.
</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Add the following rest-endpoints:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Add a rest controller for suspicious IP address
        <ul>
            <li>get a list <code>GET /antifraud/suspicious-ip</code></li>
            <li>add an item to the list <code>POST /antifraud/suspicious-ip</code> having a <em>request-param</em>
                <code>ip</code></li>
            <li>remove an item from the list of suspicious IPs <code>DELETE /antifraud/suspicious-ip/{ip}</code> having
                a <em>path-param</em> <code>ip</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Add a rest controller for the Stolen cards</p>

        <ul>
            <li>get a list <code>GET /antifraud/stolencard</code></li>
            <li>add an item to the list <code>POST /antifraud/stolencard</code> having a <em>request-param</em>
                <code>serial</code></li>
            <li>remove an item from the list of suspicious IPs <code>DELETE /antifraud/stolen/{serial}</code> having
                a <em>path-param</em> <code>serial</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Improve the transaction check </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhance a transaction to be an object which send as <em>request-bod</em> with two fields
                <em>ip-address</em>
                and <em>card-number</em>
                <pre><code class="language-json">
                    {
                        "amount": 159,
                        "ip-adress": "127.0.0.1",
                        "card-number": "1234-5678-9012-3456"
                    }
                </code></pre>
            </li>
            <li> Enrich the fraud detection method <code> GET {{antifraud-host}}/api/antifraud/ </code> to prohibit any
                transaction of the stolen cards as well as suspicious IP addresses.
                If the transaction is not from suspicious IP or stolen card.
            </li>
            <li>
                Enrich the response body of the <code> GET {{antifraud-host}}/api/antifraud/ </code> with a property
                <em>message</em> which is <em>empty</em> in case of <em>ALLOWED</em> transaction and for
                <em>PROHIBITED</em>
                and <em>MANUAL_PROCESSING</em> has the following value:
                <ul>
                    <li>In case of <em>MANUAL_PROCESSING</em> the message would be <code> The transactions with this
                        price
                        needs to be confirmed manually.</code></li>
                    <li>In case of <em>PROHIBITED</em> because of the price of transaction the message should contain
                        <em>
                            A transaction is above allowed value.
                        </em></li>
                    <li>In cse of <em>PROHIBITED</em> because of the stolen card the message contains <code>The
                        given card is in the blacklist</code></li>
                    <li>In cse of <em>PROHIBITED</em> because of the prohibited IP address it the message contains
                        <code>The given IP address is suspicious.</code></li>
                    <li> If a transaction is <em>PROHIBITED</em> and more than one of the reason can be applied on it
                        the message would contains all of the reasons.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Examples</h2>
<h3>Sample of the data structures</h3>

<h3>Sample Scenario</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Add a prohibited IP</li>
    <li>Add a stolen card</li>
    <li>Ask for a valid trx</li>
    <li>ask for prohibited IP</li>
</ol>



<p>...</p>

<h3>TODO</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Check rest parameter types not to be misleading or bad design</li>
    <li>Think about having search for cards and IPs</li>
    <li>The DataType for IP address in java is InetAddress. Think about either type to be that or explaining it
        somewhere. <a
