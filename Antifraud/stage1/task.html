<h2>Description</h2>

<p><br/>
    Here, in the beginning, a simple measure is taken in order to prevent fraudsters from illegally transferring a large
    portion of the currency from an account. Suppose some scammers have just gotten access to confidential financial
    information through some phishing or pharming attacks. They immediately try to transfer as much currency as possible
    to their accounts. Most of the time the account holder is not aware of the attack. Hence, the antifraud system
    should prevent it before it is too late.</p>

<p>In the first stage, you need to create a simple rest endpoint that calculates whether a transaction is ALLOWED,
    PROHIBITED, or need MANUAL_PROCESSING by using the amount of the transaction.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Create a rest web-service<code>GET api/antifraud/transaction</code>which get a <em>transaction amount</em>&nbsp;with
    name <em>amount as&nbsp;RequestParam&nbsp;</em>of type <em>Long</em>&nbsp;and specify the type based on the amount
    of the transaction:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Transactions having amount lower or equal to 200 are ALLOWED</li>
    <li>Transactions with an amount greater than 200 and lower or equal than 1500 need&nbsp;MANUAL_PROCESSING</li>
    <li>Transactions having amount greater than 1500 are&nbsp;PROHIBITED</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above GET methods return <u>HTTP status code <em>200</em></u>.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ol>
    <li><code>GET {{antifraud-host}}/api/antifraud/transaction?amount=150</code><br/>
        <br/>

        <br/>
        &nbsp;
    </li>
    <li><code>GET {{antifraud-host}}/api/antifraud/transaction?amount=870</code><br/>
        &nbsp;
        <p><img alt="" src="https://ucarecdn.com/6eeb0d3e-7c93-428b-ac00-552687a80dfb/"/></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>TODOS</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Integer or Long is never appropriate data type for transferring money. Either explain it or replace integer with
        BigDecimal. You can do it in step 3
