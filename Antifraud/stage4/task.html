<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    An enterprise anti-fraud system has hundreds of merchant users who take advantage of the system by only checking
    validity of the transactions.
    Such kind of users do not need to modify and see list of stolen cards, suspicious IP addresses and even other users.
    On the other hand there are limited number of support users who are responsible for reporting stolen cards/IPs and
    excluding them from blacklist.
    This type of users do not need to have access to the user management.
    Finally, there are few users who are completely trusted and are allowed to access and modify more sensitive data.
</p>
<h2>Theory</h2>
<p>
    <h3> Authentication and Authorization</h3>
    In this stage authentication and authorization is added to the antifraud-system.
    Authentication refers to the confirmation of user identity by checking their PIN, password, fingerprint, or face.
    On the other hand, authentication refers to the confirmation of an already authenticated user for an specific
    activity in the system.
    <h3>Encoding the Password</h3>
    Here authentication is done through a <code>password</code> field that should be sent with the username in each
    request.
    The received password is compared with the user password in order to confirm user identity.
    It is not good practice to maintain password inside the system as plain text...
    What is hash function ... MD5 (for simplicity)
    <h3> Basic Authentication Header</h3>
    HEADER: "authorization": encode(basic: user+password)
</p>

<h2>
    Question: Is changing username allowed? Probable answer: only by the admin user? For simplicity NO
</h2>

<h2>Question: Add ID to the users and transaction??? What about other models</h2>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Enrich the User model by adding field <code>password</code> ...</li>
    <li>Passwords are immediately encoded with ...</li>
    <li>Add an endpoint to user controller for changing password ...</li>
    <li>Basic user can only do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Change her/his password</li>
            <li>Ask for the validity of a transaction</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A support users can do whatever a basic user can do. In addition, the following are allowed for a support user
        <ul>
            <li>Stolen Card Management, i.e. get list, add, remove</li>
            <li>Suspicious IP Management, i.e. get list, add, remove</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Updating/Adding/Removing users, are only done by the admin users.
        In the other world admin users have access to every endpoint of the system.
    </li>
    <li>Add a preconfigured admin user admin with password admin should be added by default with username=admin, password=admin, and name=admin...</li>
</ol>
