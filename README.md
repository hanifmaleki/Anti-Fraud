About
Artificial Intelligence refers to the set of algorithms that enable machines to mimic human thinking in order to solve the problems that need human intelligence. In the last two decades, the modern artificial intelligence algorithms have managed to think even better than the human in many fields. For instance Natural Language Processing(NLP), pattern recognition,  autonomous drive, playing chess games like chess and go, and medical diagnosis.

The vast majority of these improvements have been achieved in the branch of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is an area in artificial intelligence that is based on learning from experience by taking advantage of finding patterns in data.
