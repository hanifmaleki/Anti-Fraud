## About
Artificial Intelligence refers to the set of algorithms that enable machines to mimic human thinking in order to solve the problems that need human intelligence. In the last two decades, the modern artificial intelligence algorithms have managed to think even better than the human in many fields. For instance Natural Language Processing(NLP), pattern recognition,  autonomous drive, playing chess games like chess and go, and medical diagnosis.

The vast majority of these improvements have been achieved in the branch of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is an area in artificial intelligence that is based on learning from experience by taking advantage of finding patterns in data.

Practice-based project from the financial field. The service receives a request with data on clients, their purchases, etc. The service answers whether to let the transaction happen or not. There are 3 types of service answers:

* ALLOWED,
* PROHIBITED,
* MANUAL_PROCESSING.
## Learning Outcomes
* Spring Rest
* Spring Security
* Machine Learning Fundamentals
* Fraud Detection Systems
* Rule-Based System
* Neural Networks
* Short descriptions

## Stage 1
### Simple Transaction Status Query
Learn and practice basic of Spring Web and REST controllers bz implementing a simple logic that specifz the validity of a transaction with simple conditions.

## Stage 2
### User Management

Practice Rest controllers in more depth implementing GET, POST, and DELETE methods and transferring more complicated JSON objects through REST API. Also, practice with different parameter types.



## Implementation Details 
Each stage is an independent standalone project
